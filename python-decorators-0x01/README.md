# Project Description
This project focuses on mastering Python decorators to enhance database operations in Python applications. Through hands-on tasks, learners will create custom decorators to log queries, handle connections, manage transactions, retry failed operations, and cache query results. The tasks are designed to simulate real-world challenges, providing learners with an in-depth understanding of Pythonâ€™s capabilities for dynamic and reusable code in database management.

## Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher installed.
SQLite3 database setup with a users table for testing.
A working knowledge of Python decorators and database operations.
Familiarity with Git and GitHub for project submission.
Strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail.

## Key Highlights
### Task 0: Logging Database Queries

- Create a decorator to log all SQL queries executed by a function.
- Learn to intercept function calls to enhance observability.

### Task 1: Handle Database Connections with a Decorator
- Automate database connection handling with a decorator.
- Eliminate boilerplate code for opening and closing connections.


### Task 2: Transaction Management Decorator
- Implement a decorator to manage database transactions (commit/rollback).
- Ensure robust error handling and data consistency.


### Task 3: Retry Database Queries
- Build a decorator to retry database operations on failure.
- Introduce resilience against transient database issues.

### Task 4: Cache Database Queries
- Implement a decorator to cache query results.
- Optimize performance by avoiding redundant database calls.
